# Web-Server-Backend
Backend for a fully functioning Web Server that responds to requests from your own web browser. HTTPS requests are received by the running Web Server program, they are parsed, and the relevant HTML webpage is served to the web client. This program implements the backend logic for the Networking and Socket programming in C++. This can be extended by adding a more interactive UI and a better looking design for the webpage. Nevertheless, the purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for a web server that serves more artistic and interactive web pages using technologies such as CSS or Javascript.
